Yo hombres, just add a read me
For now this should be our update page:
- Simple Parser
- Simple Expression Tree Builder (INFIX ONLY)
- Postfix Traversal

NEED: (IDK all of it so just add)
- Evaluators
- The other traversals and tree builders
- help and guide checks
- actual input specification (the POST to INFIX) currently you cant specify and its always infix to postfix

NOTES:
- always try to catch errors
- clear comments
